Herald Journal-to-XMPP bridge
==============================

Herald is a simple daemon watching the systemd journal and sending selected
messages over XMPP.  It can be used as a simple server monitoring solution.


Quick start
------------

1. Install the herald package for your distribution (preferred), or install
   from source ([Go 1.11][golang] or later is required):
   ``` shell
   make
   sudo make install
   ```
2. Edit `/etc/herald/config.toml`.  You should at least set up your XMPP server
   and credentials, and the list of recipients.
3. `sudo systemctl enable --now herald.service`

[golang]: https://golang.org/dl/


Configuration
--------------

Herald will look for its configuration file in several locations in the
following order:

1. The path given as `-config PATH` argument in the command line,
2. `config.toml` in the current working directory,
3. `/etc/herald/config.toml`,
4. `/etc/herald.toml`.

See [`etc/config.toml`](etc/config.toml) for a commented example.
